========== GENERAL ===================

- check whether all "header" keywords are replaced with "hero" keywords. check in global.scss too.
- optimize all <img> with <Image/>
- refacture classnames that need to be refactured, in jsx and sass
- make sure user gets custom screen when error happens. this will be done simply using nextJS routing
- add new animations using framer motion on all sections

========= COMPONENTS ================

* NAV
- finish mobile nav stylisation
- consider transparent bg on navbar and yellow links by default

* HERO
- add effect on a span that will change content every sec, like: "I am {lorem/ispus/dolor}" these words will change in their span container every second, find a way to achieve this 
- add 3d planet earth that is rotating by itself on X axis only by default but the user can also rotate it
- perhaps add particles using "ts-particles" npm package

* ABOUT
= this section is done i think

* === SKILLS SECTION DONE, DO FINAL CHECKS BEFORE PRODUCTION

* PROJECTS
- in projects section make cards wider and by default 2 in a row then 1 on mobile
- in projects section add icons that will represent technologies used in the project
- in projects section add gifs so that when user hovers over a card gif becomes active
- in projects section add hover effect which will be border color but not full, that will circle around border (itself) 

* FOOTER
- use 3rd party to make form functional

========= SPECIAL ================

dont forget to implement "thank-you page" that will let user know the msg in the form has been sent
